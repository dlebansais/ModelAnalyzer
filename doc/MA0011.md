# MA0011 Method require clause is violated

The require clause puts some requirement on the program, and the requirement cannot be satisfied.

The following situations cause analyzer error MA0011.

+ The expression in the require clause evaluates to `false`.
  * When in a public method, the require clause puts a requirement on the caller, and is assumed to evaluate to `true` in subsequent analysis.
  * When in a method that is called from within the class, the expression is evaluated, and if `false` MA0011 is reported. 
+ There is no state that can possibly allow the require clause to evaluate to `true`. For example:

````csharp
public void Foo(bool x)
// Require: x == false
// Require: x != false
{
}
````
