# MA0006 Ensure clause is invalid

The ensure clause in a method contains unsupported features.

The following situations cause analyzer error MA0006.

+ The ensure clause appears in a location that is not supported. An ensure clause must be on the line below the closing brace that follows instructions. Ensure clauses for a method with an expression body (ex: `public int Read() => 0;`) are not supported.
+ The ensure clause cannot be compiled to an expression by the C# compiler.
+ The ensure clause contains multiple expressions. Only one expression per clause is supported.

Note that if the assertion expression is invalid this will be reported as a [MA0009](/doc/MA0009.md) error.
