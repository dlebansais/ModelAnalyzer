# MA0012 Method ensure clause is violated

The ensure clause provides some guarantee to the caller, and the guarantee cannot be enforced.

The following situations cause analyzer error MA0012.

+ The expression in the ensure clause evaluates to `false`.
  * When in a public method, the ensure clause provides guarantees to the caller upon return, and is not evaluated.
  * When in a method that is called from within the class, if there exists a state for which the expression evaluates to `false` MA0011 is reported. 
+ There is no state that can possibly allow the ensure clause to evaluate to `true`. For example:

````csharp
public bool Foo(bool x)
{
	return x;
}
// Require: Result == false
// Require: Result != false
````
