# MA0008 Statement is invalid

The statement declaration contains unsupported features.

The following situations cause analyzer error MA0007.

+ The statement is not one of the following:
  * Assignment of an expression to a variable.
  * The `return` statement. 
  * The `if` `else` statement.
  * Invocation of a method, either of the same class (ex: `Add(x, y);`) or along a path (ex: `a.b.c.Add(x, y);`).
+ If the statement is an assignment, but the destination is not a field or a local variable. Only class fields and method local variables are supported as destination for an assignment.
+ If the statement is `return` but not at the end of the method. `return` is only supported if it is the last statement. 
+ If the statement is `return` of some expression but one of the local variables is `Result`. In this case, only `return Result;` is supported.    

Note that if one of the expressions involved in the statement (the condition in `if` for instance) is invalid, this will be reported as a [MA0009](/doc/MA0009.md) error.
