# MA0013 Class invariant is violated

The invariant provides some guarantee about the class state, and the guarantee cannot be enforced.

The following situations cause analyzer error MA0013.

+ The expression in the invariant clause evaluates to `false`. The expression is evaluated once the class is initialized, and at the end of each call to a public method of the class.
+ There is no state that can possibly allow the invariant clause to evaluate to `true`. For example:

````csharp
class Foo
{
	int X;
}
// Require: X == 0
// Require: X != 0
````
