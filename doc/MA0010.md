# MA0010 Class invariant is invalid

The invariant contains unsupported features.

The following situations cause analyzer error MA0010.

+ The invariant appears in a location that is not supported. A class invariant must be on the line below the closing brace that concludes the declaration of the class.
+ The invariant cannot be compiled to an expression by the C# compiler.
+ The invariant contains multiple expressions. Only one expression per invariant is supported.
