# MA0009 Expression is invalid

The expression contains unsupported features.

The following situations cause analyzer error MA0009.

+ The expression is not one of the supported expressions:
  * The `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` binary operators.
  * The remainder operator `%`.
  * The `-` unary operator.
  * Parenthesis.
  * The `!`, `&&` and `||` logical operators.
  * The `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<` and `<=` comparison operators.
  * Integer or double constants (ex: `0`, `1.0`), `true` and `false`.
  * Variables, either fields, local variables or parameters.
  * Invocation of a function (ex: `z = Add(x, y);`).
+ The expression is the remainder operator `%` but one of the operands is not an integer. Only the remainder of division between integers is supported.
+ The expression is the invocation of a function but the number of arguments doesn't match the number of parameters. Only invocation of a function with the same number of arguments as parameters is supported.
+ The expression is a local variable, but in the context of an assertion (require, ensure or class invariant). Local variables in method or class assertions is not supported.
