# MA0007 Local variable is not supported

The method local variable declaration contains unsupported features.

The following situations cause analyzer error MA0007.

+ The local type is not one of the [supported types](/README.md#supported-types).
+ The local use the same name as a field property or method parameter.
+ The local is declared with attributes. Attributes are not supported.
+ The local is declared with modifiers such as `ref` or `const`. Modifiers are not supported.  

Note that `Result` is allowed as a local variable name, but then the `return` statement in the method can only be `return Result`.

If the local is initialized with anything else than a literal constant this will be reported as a [MA0009](/doc/MA0009.md) error.
