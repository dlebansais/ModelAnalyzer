# MA0005 Require clause is invalid

The require clause in a method contains unsupported features.

The following situations cause analyzer error MA0005.

+ The require clause appears in a location that is not supported. A require clause must be on the line below the declaration of the method and its parameters, and above the opening brace. Require clauses for a method with an expression body (ex: `public int Read() => 0;`) are not supported.
+ The require clause cannot be compiled to an expression by the C# compiler.
+ The require clause contains multiple expressions. Only one expression per clause is supported.

Note that if the assertion expression is invalid this will be reported as a [MA0009](/doc/MA0009.md) error.
